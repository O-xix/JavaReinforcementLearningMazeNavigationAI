Hello! This is Teja Dasari's submission to the April 2024 UWB Hacks AI Hack-a-thon.

Not a lot to see here, but I have a livestream demo which can serve as my presentation: https://www.youtube.com/live/BzCOzyuVKSo?si=CgoTuJw0rVhGq79T
I would suggest you go see that before touching any contents of this folder.

To try out my project, navigate into the folder via path: UWBHacksAISubmission/Final Application Versions , and click on the executable file in there.

Please email tejasdasari@outlook.com if you have any questions.
