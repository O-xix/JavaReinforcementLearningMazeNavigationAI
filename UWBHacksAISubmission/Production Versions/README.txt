To use the production copy "AIMazeNavigator_HackathonSubmission_Ver2.jar", please use the shortcut "AI Maze Navigator" in the folder. If that does not work, you must create a desktop shortcut that directly runs the JAR:

1. Right-click on your desktop and choose New > Shortcut.
2. Right-click on the production copy "AIMazeNavigator_HackathonSubmission_Ver2.jar", then click on "Copy as path"
3. In the location field, enter: "java -jar " and then hit Ctrl + V to paste the path you had copied eariler.

Give it a name and save.
Now you can launch your app by double-clicking the shortcut from the desktop.
